# VEHICLE-LANE-DETECTION-
Vehicle Lane Detection is a computer vision project where the system identifies and tracks road lanes using a camera feed. It helps in guiding vehicles by detecting lane lines in real-time, which is essential for self-driving cars and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This project uses techniques like edge detection, color filtering, and perspective transforms to accurately detect lanes and improve road safety.
